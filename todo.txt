1. Need better means to store hex fields to test for duplicates. Should be able to accomplish this with an array of bit-vectors?
    Not sure if this is really necessary given the amount of data we're dealing with. Since a set of hex's shouldn't exceed a couple of 100 - at most 1000 - then binary search is prob. good enough in contrast to increase of program complexity, although will continue to ponder.
    Explore the possibility of using a union so that coords are easily packed into a long. This would allow coords to be sorted and stored in an array, and searching for them would be O(lgn).
    union
    {
        struct _i
        {
            int _col
            int _row;
        }
        long   _l;
    }
         
    The issue with this approach is that negative coords are problematic, since sign extension would most likely destroy the high value.
2. Project structure sucks. Will most likely re-structure all of this and replace the repository with clean code rather than store all the refactoring pollution for posterity.
    Done
3. Need a better strategy for performing facing bias. 
    Implemented operators --,++, <<, >>, etc. Also removed use of Facing::Face as arguments and went to strict use of Facing objects. 
    Also added implicit (int) case for Facing.
4. Fix hexdrant.
    I think this is fixed for all directions, but needs more testing.
5. Implement testing harness.
6. Add arbitrary attributes to individual hex's (allows for assigning terrain attributes.)   
7. circField is broken. 
    - fixed
